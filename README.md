# dq-java-axe
coding challenge for deque: axe-java integration

Java Axe Setup
For this challenge, you'll be taking our open source axe-java integration, used to run web
accessibility tests in Java projects with the Selenium browser automation tool, and adding it to a
Java testing project that you will create. This will require Maven.
Create the following:
● A new Java project
● Use J-Unit and Selenium Webdriver testing frameworks that reach out to the following
test URL: https://dequeuniversity.com/demo/mars
● Create two (2) test cases:
1. ensure the main-nav (CSS selector) has been loaded, and
2. perform an accessibility scan of the page
● Integrate axe-core-maven-html into the accessibility scan test case (the second bullet
above)
● Return the results from the scan to the console. Bonus points for using assertions to
check violations.
You may use all publicly available resources to help you get this setup and running.
When you're done, please host the challenge on Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab or another hosted
version control, or send us a package we can stand up ourselves.
